// In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

// "Hello!" => "Holle!"
// "Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
// "Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
// For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.

// Good luck!


const reverseVowels = str => {
    let vowels = str.replace(/[^aeiou]/gi, '').split('');
    return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, _ => vowels.pop());
    
  };
